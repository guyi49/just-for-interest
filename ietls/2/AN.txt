    I agree with the opinion that some information is too important or too valuable to be shard freely.Nowadays,there are
some convenient media that appear in our daily life,such as smart phone,website in computer. More and more people prefer
to get something important that they want from their phones through various social apps or information apps.
    Gradually,scientific research or some organizations also publish something official or valuable through social media.
Evidently,it has became a trend at present.Therefore,important or valuable information should be released freely in kinds
of media.Furthermore,it's much easier for them to accept information which they desire,so they may have their judgments and
express opinions.
    Thus,we can realize that people are willing to accept the convenience and timeliness of information which are shared
in everywhere.However,the mode of information dissemination is expended with the development of science technology.So that
the valuable information can play a greater value.
