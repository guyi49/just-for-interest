- 范文

**It is quite common these days** for young people in many countries to have a break from studying after graduating from high school.  The trend **is not restricted to** rich students who have the money to travel, **but is also evident** among poorer students who choose to work and become **economically** independent for a **period** of time. 

The reasons for this trend **may involve** the **recognition** that a young adult who passes directly from school to university is **rather** restricted in terms of general knowledge and experience of the world.  By **contrast**, those who have spent some time **earning a living** or traveling to other places, have a broader view of life and better **personal resources** to **draw on**.  They **tend to** be more independent, which is very important factor in academic study and research, as well as giving them an advantage in terms of **coping with** the challenges of student life. 

However, there are certainly dangers in taking time off at the important age.  Young adults may end up never returning to their studies or finding it difficult to **readapt** to an academic **environment**. They may think that it is better to continue in a particular job, or to do something **completely** different from a university course.  But overall, I think this is less likely today, when academic qualifications are essential for getting a reasonable career. 

**My own view is that** young people should **be encouraged** to **broaden their horizons**.  That is the best way for them to get a clear perspective of what they are hoping to do with their lives and why.  Students with such a perspective are **usually** the most **effective** and **motivated** ones and taking a year off may be the best way to **gain** this. 

### 题目2：交通 提高油价 有绝对词一定要不同意

 ![image-20220525100655827](D:\1\pics\transport.png)

- increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems
- 绝对词不同意
- others:写两个点
- 双对象题
- 措施1：解决堵塞
- 措施2：解决污染
- 素材
    - 油价上涨->减少出行，减少污染
    - 各类交通工具，都会受到影响
    - 所以并不是最好的方式，还有其它更好的办法。
    - 措施
        - 堵塞
            - 限行：限时，限号
            - 优化交通系统，进行管控；大数据预测车辆流量，
            - 道路建设：拓宽，修路；
            - public transport
        - 污染
            - 新能源车
            - public transport
-----

It is traffic congestion and pollution problems that **have been becoming more and more serious nowadays**.Raising the price of gas **is** 
**considered** to be the most effective way to handle them, **which I do not approve of at all**. 



Due to increased fuel prices ,it may effect others **means of transportation.**For instance,the group of public transport could raise ticket prices. Therefore, it seems that it is not the best messure to solve these issues,there are some more suitable means to settle them.

 

It is obvious that the one of the major cause of the traffic jam is that there are great quantities of cars.With the development of the big data,we can use the technology to predict the **vehicles flow** to **optimize** the transportation system.Besides,I suggest that we need to lanuch the project of road construction to contain great number of vehicles.And it includes **widening or repairing the roads** and building **viaducts**.



I think to **tackle** the problems of pollution, we can appeal people to purchase the electric cars instead of petrol cars,which is cleaner and effective way to reduce vehicle **emissions** and noise.What is the most significant is that the goverment should focus on developing and providing more green and convenient public transport services so that people have more choices to take.In addiation,it can not only lessen the traffic but also reduce pollution.



In conclusion, I believe that people should set up the **awareness** of taking public transport and relevant departments improve the traffic system to ease the traffic pressure and contamination.

There are several nations advocate that the young earn a living or have a tour during the period between graduating from high school and attending a college.Whether the benefits of doing this are more than the drawbacks is a frequent topic of discussion among the pubic.My own view is that the favorable aspects carry more weight than the adverse impacts.

### homework
#### test1
- Some people say that the best way to improve public health is by increasing the number of sports facilities. 
- Others, however, say that this would have little effect on public health and that other measures are required.
- Discuss both these views and give your own opinion. 
---
Raising awareness of public health among the population has been hotly debated.Besides,the method of constructing a 
great quantity of sports equipments is extremely advocated by some people.On the contrary,it seems that those who hold 
opposite a view that would have not any impact on public health and more effective approaches are adopted,which I do not
fully approve of it.
#### test2
- Rising university fees and scarce employment prospects for graduates have led some people to say that universities
should not teach arts subjects, like philosophy and history, and only offer practical degree courses that maximise 
chances of employment.
- To what extent do you agree or disagree?
---
Because of these issues that the universities charge much and a great quantity of employers need more talents,
some people argue that reduce the teaching of courses that are not practical and just establish some courses,which are 
more suitable for the employment of graduates.Based on the fact that the university itself is a microcosm of diversified 
society,it is hard for me to agree with this view.
