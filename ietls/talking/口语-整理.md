When it comes to a famous athlete I know, it should be Eileen Gu.
I knew **her because of a piece of news**, and it said that **an American skiing athlete was going to represent China at Beijing Winter Olympics**. **So that’s why I started to take interest in her and set out to search for more information about her**.

Well…I found that Eileen is a girl that is of **medium build and above-average height**. We can always see a big smile on her face. I think that shows her confidence. Overall, I guess **nobody can deny** that she is a pretty attractive girl.

**In terms of her achievements in the field of** sports, there is a lot I want to share with you. The first one I can think of is that she can **win three medals including 2 gold ones and 1 silver one at the age of 18**. I believe this is impressive. I can still remember when I was 18, I could only watch these athletes compete in the games. Another achievement I want to talk about is **her influence on our society**. Numerous young people have **been encouraged to be interested in** skiing. And I am no exception.

I also want to say that this **has further promoted the achievement of snow industry**. Maybe we can witness more young people win gold medals at Winter Olympics for our country. So that’s what I want to say about Eileen.
