    If I really like the person then I can talk to them for ages, but if I don’t really like them then I don’t want to talk to them.

      we can practise speaking in another language with each other.

    another language with each other.
    
    Do you remember a time when you need to cooperate with others?
    - When I was a sophomore, the final assignment of communication and speech class was to shoot an interview video in a group of 
      about five to seven people.And it needed to be completed by division of labor.
    - I was responsible for writing scripts and being an interviewer.Some people needed to be photographers and others
        needed to participate in video editing.
    - This tested our cooperation ability.Finally, we won the first place in the group.
    
    - At university last year, for my Spanish class we had to do a group project between three of us, and present a 
    slideshow about Colombia. It had to be done in Spanish, and we decided to split the jobs, so I did the speaking, 
    another person did the music, and another person did the graphics. It was fun, because I liked my classmates, 
    but it was hard because we had very different personalities! We just had to be patient and listen to each other.
