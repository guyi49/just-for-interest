      about five to seven people.And it needed to be completed by division of labor.

        needed to participate in video editing.
    - This tested our cooperation ability.Finally, we won the first place in the group.
    
    - At university last year, for my Spanish class we had to do a group project between three of us, and present a 
    slideshow about Colombia. It had to be done in Spanish, and we decided to split the jobs, so I did the speaking, 
    another person did the music, and another person did the graphics. It was fun, because I liked my classmates, 
    but it was hard because we had very different personalities! We just had to be patient and listen to each other.
