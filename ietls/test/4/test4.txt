1. 一些学生的行为，由于缺乏关爱，通过错误的方式引起老师或家长的的注意；
2. 学生在青少年时期处于身体和大脑发育成长的阶段，他们的认知也是成长的。建议学校定期开展有关于青少年的心理讲座，引导让他们了解自己。

我认为最主要的两个原因是青少年缺少心理健康教育以及家人忽视了孩子在学校的关系。
基于身边的例子，我们可以了解到大部分都是因为缺少家人的陪伴以及同学老师的理解。

them are due to the lack of family accompany and the understanding of classmates and teachers.That's why they get attention

relationship or status in school by their families.
