1. 一些学生的行为，由于缺乏关爱，通过错误的方式引起老师或家长的的注意；学业的压力；父母的期望；
2. 学生在青少年时期处于身体和大脑发育成长的阶段，他们的认知也是成长的。他们对于一些错误行为不以为然，
3. 我建议学校定期开展有关于青少年的心理讲座，让专家疏导学生的心理问题，从而改善学生的行为。除此之外，也可以让学生家人参与其中。
4. 我希望家长们对待孩子给予多点耐心与陪伴，少点谩骂与指责。在教育孩子时，为什么不尝试给予多点耐心与陪伴，少点指责与谩骂。
5. 于此同时，我也希望学生们对待自己的行为有着正确的认识，要养成良好的行为习惯。

我认为最主要的两个原因是青少年缺少心理健康教育以及家人忽视了孩子在学校的关系。
基于身边的例子，我们可以了解到大部分都是因为缺少家人的陪伴以及同学老师的理解。

    In large quantities of countries, the schools have faced serious problems in students' behavior. Therefore, the problems
of students' behavior has always been concerned by people.
    There are various factor may give rise to such problems. For instance, academic pressure, parent's expectations
and interpersonal relationships. Based on the examples around us, we can know that most of them are due to the lack of
family accompany and the understanding of classmates and teachers. That's why they get attention by people in some
undesirable way.
    In my submission, the major reason is are lack of mental health education for students and the neglect of children's
relationship or status in school by their families. It's obviously that students are in the stage of physical and brain
development in adolescence, and their cognition of the world is also growing. What's worse, some students disapprove of some
wrongdoing. Consequently, I suggest that the schools are supposed to carry out psychological lectures on teenagers so that
experts can dredge students' psychological problems, so as to improve their behavior. In addition, student's families can
also be involved.
    There is no doubt that parents play the most principal role in students' education and growth. When educating them,
why not try to give more patience and companionship and less criticism and abuse. What is certain is that every child
desires to love and be loved. At the same time, I also wish that the students have a correct understanding of their words
and deeds, and develop good behavior habits.
