    思路：
        1. 人们很难给出一个确切的定义关于抽象的概念。人们通常将幸福与拥有财富与权力相联系,但是也有一些人认为拥有健康的身体和积极的态度
        并且平凡的过完一生等同于拥有幸福。
        2. 有很多因素影响我们去理解什么是幸福。
        3. 有很多因素去影响我们去获得幸福。个人的学业或事业，爱情，友情，家庭。甚至是对于社会的贡献程度，又或者是从事公益性的活动。
        4. 显然这些不能作为唯一和标准的答案。在成长的过程中，你的父母，你的周围的环境总能影响你看待这个世界。
        5. 我认为获得幸福的关键是在当下总能遵从自己的内心以及辩证地看待这个世界，从而获得自己最想要的且能让自己的内心感到愉悦让自己的生活感到充实。



    It's uneasily for people to give a specific definition about abstract concept.Most People usually associate happiness
with having wealth and power.While some people are indifferent to fame and wealth.And they consider that having a healthy body,
a positive attitude and an ordinary life is equal to having happiness.Furthermore,people's attitude towards happiness will
changed with age.
    Due to the difference of personality,people hold different viewpoints about happiness.In actually,factors such as the
career of personality ,loving friendships, family. Besides,the contribution of the society or participation in public-service
activities.However,this can not be unique and standard answers to explain the happiness.Because your parents and the
surrounding environment can always affect your view of the world in the process of growing up.
    Therefore,I think the key to happiness is to always follow your heart and look at the world dialectically at any moment,
so as to acquire what you most desire, make your heart delighted and enrich your life.It seems that keep clear perspectives
is more essential in our daily life,or,more precisely,the mastery of this ability is more important.
