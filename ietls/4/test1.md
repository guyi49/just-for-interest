   The proliferation of media choices,there are three media that are most effective in my consideration in this list, 
books,television,film respectively.
   It is universally acknowledged that reading books is thought as a traditional way to absorb a vast amount of 
knowledge in our normal life.In addition,keeping reading is beneficial to help us think and communicate deeply.However,
it's not easier for those who don't receive a certain education.With the science technology developed,television appears 
in our field of vision.And we can get the first-hand information on TV.But it is also likely to mislead the people 
specially the older who have a weak consciousness to distinguish the true from false.Furthermore,some teenagers neglect 
their studies that is blamed on their addiction to watching TV.
    Under the pressure of society, the younger prefer to choose the relaxing way to stress their pressure by seeing some
films with their lovers,friends or family.Besides,it can help people improve there relationship with each other.On the 
other hand,it costs extra money during festivals and holidays.
    From my point of view,every sort of media has its own unique way to the disseminate information.we are ought to 
learn how to select something useful and valuable by media instead of just choosing only one way to exchange information.
