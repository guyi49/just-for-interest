Creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas (in words, pictures, music or film) in
whichever way they wish.There should be no government restrictions on what they do.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?


Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
1.在历史的长河中，有大量的文物瑰宝出现，惊艳了人们。一方面是人们能提高人们的审美水平，另一方面能丰富人们的精神生活。
Human history has shown that flourishing eras of artistic works were always those accompanied by great freedom.It
从中能看出在某个时代下的的社会缩影。
2.这些艺术创作及或是抽象的表达，能影响着人们的生活。比如音乐风格，服装设计，家居风格等等。
3.有创作的艺术家带来优秀的艺术创作，通过传媒媒介去表达他们对待事物，人性，甚至是这个世界的看法，这些看法能引发人们有更深层的思考。
4.这种有深度思考在一定的程度上，能推动社会的进步，提高人类思维的升华。

    I agree with the opinion that creative artists can be given the enough freedom to express their own ideas with no
government restrictions.
    Creation is the soul of art.Human history has shown that flourishing eras of artistic works were always those
accompanied by great freedom, no matter whether ideologically or politically.There artistic creations enrich people's
spiritual life of the time,left the generations to have a valuable legacy,and overall make a good part of human civilization
for ever.Without them,human civilization might take an another look undesirable to us all.
    Nearly any restriction is bound to impede artistic expression.Of all,the most destructive force is from the government
with the strong power behind it
    Thus,I shall argue that government should not stifle original ideas by severe restrictions but allow sufficient
but allow sufficient freedom as long as creative artists do not work against basic human value.
